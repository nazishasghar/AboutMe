# AboutMe
This is college project which uses Core Data, MapKit, SwiftUI, Firebase, Local Authentication.
We can save all users and contacts data locally with help of Core Data.
We can use map to find user location and can search for near by things like restuarants etc.
We have firebase as a backend database to provide chat functionality with sign in and sign out feature.
